all work is done by Sulieman Al Harthy, yours truly

HOW TO MAKE THE CODE WORK:

code is done in python
firstly, download all required libraries, which are:
    1-pytesseract
    2-opencv-python
    3-RegEx
    4-datetime
next, for the pytesseract OCR to work, go to:
https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
and download the tesseract.exe file that corresponds to your system type (32 bit or 64 bit)

replace line 6 with the directory of the tesseract.exe file you downloaded

after that, you should be good to go. thank you!

METHODOLOGY:
firstly a flowchart was done (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TTqX_8EW9l7bK6rD3UfBNaZFi78z6_I3/view?usp=sharing) and then the coding started
reasons as to why specific lines of code were writen are detaailed in the comments avaliable on almost every line. enjoy the code!
